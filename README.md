# Database Manager - Backend
The goal of the project was to create a flexible and universal manager to manage any database by the user, which will be fully configurable from the application server (backend). Its idea is to "write the front once and enjoy it all the time". Everything from the login method, through the menu displayed to the user, and the definition of the size of the uploaded file is configured from the backend level.
